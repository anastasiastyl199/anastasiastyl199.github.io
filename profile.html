        <h1>SWOT Analysis</h1>
        <h2>Strengths:</h2>
        <p>My strengths are my determination, when I put my mind on something I don't let go until it is done. Also, I am a very creative person, I like to think outside the box. In addition to that, I consider myself to be open minded, although I have very strong opinions I am willing to listen to, and respect every opinion there is when it comes to anything because I believe that a persons mindset constantly evolves.</p>
        <h2>Weaknesses:</h2>
        <p>My weaknesses are that I might need to see or hear the same thing more than twice for it to stick a landing in my brain, and when it comes to memory it is very random what I am able to keep, so I need to ask the same questions again and again to keep the information. Another weakness of mine is that I am a person who likes to speak her mind, if I see something I do not agree with I am going to talk about it.</p>
        <h2>Opportunities:</h2>
        <p>I see opportunities everywhere and all the time. I believe an opportunity presents itself to a person when the person chooses to see it, in my eyes, opportunities are meant to be taken because that is the way an individual moves forward in life. If I don't take an opportunity how will I change my life to the better? Why settle for okay when there is the opportunity for great?</p>
        <h2>Threats:</h2>
        <p>To me a threat is anything you let be a threat so if one chooses to let something or someone be a threat then there is something they fear. So in my opinion, if I choose to be optimistic then my consciousness will not allow anything to present itself as a threat.</p>
