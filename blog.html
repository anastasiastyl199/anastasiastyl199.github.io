        <h2>SWOT Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Strengths:</h3>
        <p>My strengths are my determination; when I put my mind on something I don't let go until it is done. I am also very creative and like to think outside the box. Additionally, I consider myself open-minded, respecting every opinion because a person's mindset constantly evolves.</p>

        <h3>Weaknesses:</h3>
        <p>My weaknesses are that I might need to see or hear something multiple times for it to stick in my memory. Another weakness is that I like to speak my mind; if I disagree with something, I will openly discuss it.</p>

        <h3>Opportunities:</h3>
        <p>I see opportunities everywhere. Opportunities present themselves to those who choose to notice them. Taking opportunities is how an individual moves forward in life; why settle for okay when there is potential for great?</p>

        <h3>Threats:</h3>
        <p>To me, a threat is anything you allow to be one. If I choose to be optimistic, my mindset prevents anything from presenting itself as a real threat.</p>
